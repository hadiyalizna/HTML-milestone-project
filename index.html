    <h1><em> Discovering Bliss in the Ordinary</em></h1><hr>
    <p>Hi, I'm Hadiya Lizna and in this page I  would like to talk about "Finding joy in everyday Life"
        .In the hustle of our daily routines,its easy to overlook the simple magic that surrounds us-the joy found in everyday life.
    It's in the warmth of morning sunlight,the laughter shared with freinds,and the quit moments of reflection.
    joy need not to be grand spectacle;its resides in the ordinary.So as we navigate our journeys,lets cultivate a spirit of joy .
    its not just a destination;its a way of travelling through life,finding beuaty in each step.</p>
